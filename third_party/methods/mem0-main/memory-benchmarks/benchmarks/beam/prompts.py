ANSWER_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant with access to stored memories from prior conversations with a user.
Use these memories to answer the following question as accurately and completely as possible.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Scan ALL provided memories before answering — do not stop after the first relevant one.
2. If multiple memories contain relevant information, combine and cross-reference them.
3. If the memories contain contradictory information, prefer the more recent one.
4. If the memories don't contain enough information to answer, say exactly: "I don't have enough information to answer this question."
5. For temporal questions: pay attention to dates and relative time references.
6. For ordering questions: present events in chronological order.
7. For preference questions: use the most recently stated preference.
8. Be specific and direct — include exact names, dates, numbers, and details from the memories.
9. Do NOT invent or assume information that isn't in the memories.

ANSWER:"""

JUDGE_PROMPT = """Evaluate whether the following LLM response demonstrates compliance with the specified RUBRIC CRITERION.

QUESTION:
{question}

LLM RESPONSE:
{response}

RUBRIC CRITERION:
{answer}

SCORING GUIDELINES:

First, determine whether the rubric criterion is a POSITIVE requirement (the response SHOULD include something) or a NEGATIVE constraint (the response SHOULD NOT include something).

**For POSITIVE requirements** (response should contain, mention, or demonstrate something):
- **1.0 (Complete Compliance)**: The required element is present, accurate, and complete. The response fully and clearly satisfies the rubric criterion.
- **0.5 (Partial Compliance)**: The required element is partially present, has minor inaccuracies, or is incomplete. The core intent is present but not fully realized.
- **0.0 (No Compliance)**: The required element is missing, incorrect, or the response is entirely off-topic / non-responsive.

**For NEGATIVE constraints** (response should NOT contain or should avoid something):
- **1.0 (Complete Compliance)**: The response is responsive to the question AND the prohibited element is absent.
- **0.5 (Partial Compliance)**: The response is responsive but contains a borderline or ambiguous reference to the prohibited element.
- **0.0 (No Compliance)**: The prohibited element is present in the response, OR the response is non-responsive (off-topic, refusal, empty).

**Compound statement handling**: If the rubric criterion contains "and" or commas connecting multiple required elements:
- All elements present and correct = 1.0
- Some (but not all) elements present and correct = 0.5
- No elements present or correct = 0.0

EVALUATION RULES:
1. **Semantic tolerance**: Paraphrases and synonyms are acceptable. The response does not need to use the exact same words as the rubric.
2. **Numeric and date equivalence**: Treat equivalent representations as identical. "$68,000" = "68k" = "sixty-eight thousand dollars". "2 years" = "24 months". Prefer normalized comparison for numbers, currencies, dates, and durations.
3. **Case / punctuation / whitespace tolerance**: Differences in capitalization, punctuation, and whitespace must be ignored when comparing content.
4. **Hedging tolerance**: Do not penalize hedging language ("I think", "probably", "it seems"), passive voice, or verbosity if the substantive content satisfies the rubric criterion.
5. **Style neutrality**: Do not penalize for tone, formatting, or length unless the rubric criterion specifically requires a particular format.
6. **Responsiveness**: If the LLM response is completely off-topic or refuses to answer, score 0.0.
7. **Independence**: Evaluate this criterion in isolation — do not consider other rubric items.
8. **Specificity matters**: Vague or generic answers that could apply to any question score lower than specific, detailed answers.

STEP-BY-STEP EVALUATION:
Follow these steps in order:
1. **Understand the Requirement**: Read the rubric criterion and classify it as a positive requirement or a negative constraint.
2. **Parse Compound Statements**: If the criterion contains multiple sub-requirements joined by "and" or commas, identify each element separately.
3. **Check Compliance**: Compare the LLM response against each element, applying the tolerance rules above (semantic, numeric, case, hedging).
4. **Assign Score**: Use the appropriate scoring table (positive or negative) and compound-statement rule to determine the score.
5. **Provide Reasoning**: Write a concise explanation referencing which elements were or were not satisfied.

Return your evaluation as a JSON object with exactly two fields:
{{"score": <0.0 or 0.5 or 1.0>, "reason": "<one concise sentence explaining your score>"}}"""
